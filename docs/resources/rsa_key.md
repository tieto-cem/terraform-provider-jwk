# jwk_rsa_key (Resource)

This resource creates and manages RSA keys for JSON Web Key (JWK) purposes.
It can be used to either sign ('sig') or encrypt ('enc') data using RSA algorithms.
The 'kid' field specifies the unique identifier for the key, while the 'use' field determines 
whether the key is used for signing or encryption. The 'alg' field defines the signing or 
encryption algorithm to be used, and the 'size' field specifies the key size in bits.

## Schema

### Required

- `kid` (String) The Key ID (KID) is a unique identifier for the key. It is used to distinguish different keys in a key set.
- `size` (Number) The size of the key in bits. For RSA keys, common values are 2048, 3072, or 4096.
- `use` (String) Specifies the intended use of the key. Allowed values: `sig` (for signing) and `enc` (for encryption).

### Optional

- `alg` (String) The cryptographic algorithm associated with the key. For RSA keys, common values include `RS256`, `RS384`, and `RS512` for signing, and `RSA-OAEP`, `RSA-OAEP-256` for encryption.

### Read-Only

- `json` (String, Sensitive) The JSON representation of the key in JWK (JSON Web Key) format. This value is automatically generated.
