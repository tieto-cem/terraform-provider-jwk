# jwk_oct_key (Resource)

This resource creates and manages symmetric keys (kty: oct) for JSON Web Key (JWK) purposes.

## Schema

### Required

- `kid` (String) The Key ID (KID) is a unique identifier for the key. It is used to distinguish different keys in a key set.
- `size` (Number) The size of the key in bits. The size needs to be divisible by 8. You can use Terraform to calcualte bit count for you, like 32 * 8. This provides length of 32 bytes (256 bits)
- `use` (String) Specifies the intended use of the key. Allowed values: `sig` (for signing) and `enc` (for encryption).

### Optional

- `alg` (String) The cryptographic algorithm associated with the key. `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512`, `none` for signing, `A128GCMKW`, `A128KW`, `A192GCMKW`, `A192KW`, `A256GCMKW`, `A256KW`, `PBES2-HS256+A128KW`, `PBES2-HS384+A192KW`, `PBES2-HS512+A256KW`, `dir` for encryption

### Read-Only

- `json` (String, Sensitive) The JSON representation of the key in JWK (JSON Web Key) format. This value is automatically generated.



## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "jwk_oct_key" "oct1" {
    use = "enc"  
    kid = "oct-1"
    size = 256
}
```

## Importing

You can import an Oct key by providing the json representation of the key. 
The key must be in the JWK format and should be a valid Oct key. 

```hcl
terraform import jwk_oct_key.oct1 '{"kid":"oct-1","kty":"oct","use":"enc","k":"..."}'
```
