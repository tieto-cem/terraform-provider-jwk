This resource creates and manages symmetric keys (kty: oct) for JSON Web Key (JWK) purposes.

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `kid` (String) The Key ID (KID) is a unique identifier for the key. It is used to distinguish different keys in a key set.
- `size` (Number) The size of the key in bits. The size needs to be divisible by 8. You can use Terraform to calcualte bit count for you, like 32 * 8. This provides length of 32 bytes (256 bits)
- `use` (String) Specifies the intended use of the key. Allowed values: `sig` (for signing) and `enc` (for encryption).

### Optional

- `alg` (String) The cryptographic algorithm associated with the key, such as 'HS256', 'HS384', 'HS512'.

### Read-Only

- `json` (String, Sensitive) The JSON representation of the key in JWK (JSON Web Key) format. This value is automatically generated.
